            <h2>What is Walk?</h2>
            <p>WALK is your pocket sized guide to any major sized city you happen to be in. With WALK installed on your phone, you will be able to access a large library of landmarks, restaurants, bars, art installations and much more. When you have selected a destination, you will have the option to get immediate directions to that place; as well as information about the location such as: is it child friendly; can you get food at this place; opening and closing hours. WALK also has a feature that allows for the app to send you notifications whenever you are near any points of interest that you may want to explore.</p>
