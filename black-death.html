            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>When it comes to an event such as the Black Death, understanding some of the statistics can be a daunting task. This is where data visualisation comes in. This allows us to break down large statistics into simple to understand images and graphs. I decided to create this infographic detailing some important information regarding the Black Death.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>The main aim of an infographic is to convey information about a topic in an illustrated medium. This requires a-lot of research into the chosen topic to make your infographic…well, informative. Luckily for me, there are plenty of books, videos and articles about the BlackDeath that helped to really help me understand the topic more. </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>I did run into some problems along the way though. Due to this pandemic taking place during the 14th century, it’s harder to get definitive numbers on things such as the death toll, deaths per year or daily death rate. This caused a few problems but the estimations for the statistics regarding the Black Death are all seen as the official numbers.

            <h2>Illustrations</h2>
            <p>When it came to actually illustrating the infographic, a-lot of consideration had to go into what style to go for when covering such a morbid topic. I opted to use this flat design with geometric shapes as the basis for every illustration. I used a simple shading style with a few uses of gradients throughout my illustrations. This meant that the viewer would not feel overwhelmed with all the illustrations. </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>For the colours, I wanted to stay away from the typical darker colour pallets used in infographics focusing on morbid topics. I decided to create my own colour scheme based on an image I found dating back to the 14th century. The colours I ended up with were reds, yellows, off-whites, and dark greys. </p>
